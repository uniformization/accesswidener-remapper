# accesswidener-remapper

Remaps `.accesswidener` files from intermediary to named. This is useful when you have a compiled mod and you need to remap the accesswidener file included with the mod.

## Usage

Run `node index.js <mappings file> <input> <output>`

The mappings file should be your intermediary to named mappings. This only works for TinyV2 mappings.
